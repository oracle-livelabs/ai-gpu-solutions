# Introduction

## About this Workshop


In this workshop, we will explore in detail how to use AIStore which is a lightweight object storage system with the capability to linearly scale out with each added storage node and a special focus on petascale deep learning.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour

### Objectives

The goal of this workshop is to provide hands-on examples demonstrating the integration and use of AIStore. Participants will gain practical experience with interacting with AIStore in an OCI environment which can be helpful to deploy and scale datasets for machine learning usecases.

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Bring up an AIStore cluster in OCI VM Instance
* Use AIStore cli commands into OCI VM Instance to list buckets, copy buckets and delete buckets.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud account
* Administrator permissions or permissions to use the OCI Compute and Network
