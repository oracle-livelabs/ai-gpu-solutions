# Start the Workshop

## Task

In this workshop, we will focus on implementing and demonstrating fraud detection workflows using NVIDIA's Morpheus framework on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The workshop provides hands-on experience in setting up, deploying, and utilizing Morpheus's AI capabilities to process and analyze large-scale datasets for financial fraud detection. You will work with GPU-accelerated environments on OCI, leveraging tools like RAPIDS AI, PyTorch, and Jupyter Notebooks for efficient and scalable AI solutions.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour

### Objectives

The objective of this workshop is to provide hands-on experience with deploying and demonstrating the Morpheus framework for fraud detection workflows on OCI.

By the end of this workshop, you will:

* Learn how to set up a GPU-accelerated environment on OCI for Morpheus using automation scripts.
* Explore fraud detection workflows with Morpheus using datasets such as TabFormer and Sparkov.
* Gain experience in running and interacting with Jupyter Notebooks to visualize and evaluate AI/ML workflows.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Access to an Oracle Cloud account
* Sufficient permissions to create and manage Compute Instances, especially access to GPU-enabled shapes (e.g., A10).
* Ability to create resources with Public IP addresses
* Basic familiarity with Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and AI/ML workflows is recommended but not mandatory.

## Learn More

* [NVIDIA Morpheus](https://developer.nvidia.com/morpheus-cybersecurity)
* [Morpheus Experimental Github Repo](https://github.com/nv-morpheus/morpheus-experimental/tree/branch-24.10/)

You may now proceed to the next lab.
