# Introduction

## About this Workshop


In this workshop, we will explore in detail how KubeRay and Kueue collaborate to orchestrate advanced scheduling for Ray applications. We'll examine how these tools integrate to manage complex workloads, enabling more efficient resource allocation and optimized performance for Ray-based tasks in a Kubernetes environment. This deep dive will help participants understand the full potential of combining KubeRay and Kueue for seamless, scalable workload management.

We'll explore techniques like:
1. Priority scheduling: Prioritize AI/ML tasks to ensure production reliability and improve cost efficiency.
2. Quota management: Share resources between two teams in different namespaces by using Kueue cohorts to borrow resources, optimizing resource utilization for AI/ML tasks within the cluster.

Estimated Workshop Time: 3 hours

### Objectives

The goal of this workshop is to provide hands-on examples demonstrating the use of Kueue and Kuberay. Participants will gain practical experience with the two techniques discussed earlier, helping them become familiar with how these tools can be applied to effectively manage and optimize workloads in a Kubernetes environment.

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Bring up OKE infrastructure with Kueue and Kuberay-Operator installed using ORM stack
* Run a rayjob in OKE with an AI/ML tasks
* Maximize resource efficiency while enhancing cost-effectiveness and production reliability in OKE cluster

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud account
* Administrator permissions or permissions to use the OCI Compute, OKE and Identity Domains
* Ability to provision A10 vm instances in OCI
