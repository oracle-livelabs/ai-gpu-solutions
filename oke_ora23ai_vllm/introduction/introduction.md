# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Retrieval-augmented generation is a paradigm that couples the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models(LLMs), particularly large language models, in NLP. In an improved RAG pipeline, an LLM uses external data relevant to answering questions or generating responses, retrieved from a vector database. In particular, RAG is very useful because it enables LLMs to give correct responses concerning up-to-date data, or specialized knowledge from domains they were never trained on. This is achieved in a way that reduces the need for continual model retraining and fine-tuning, making the approach more cost-effective and scalable.

Estimated Workshop Time: 3 hours

### **Objectives**

Objective of this workshop is to set-up a RAG application in OCI using Resource manager:

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Configure & set-up JupyterHub Notebook
* Run a RAG Chatbot application

### **Prerequisites**

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud account
* Administrator privileges or access rights to the OCI tenancy
* Ability to provision A10 instances in OCI
* Ability to provision an Oracle 23ai Autonomous Database
* Ability to create resources with Public IP addresses (Load Balancer, Instances, OKE API Endpoint)
* Access to Hugging Face and acceptance of selected model license agreements
* Database admin password stored in a vault secret.
