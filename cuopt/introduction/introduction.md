# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop we will run Nvidia container on oci instance with an A10 shape which has GPU. You will launch an A10 instance with oracle linux and run a set of commands to achieve it.

NVIDIA cuOpt is an optimization tool that specializes in routing. It is run as a microservice in the cloud using the container provided. The cuOpt microservice leverages OpenAPI standards, serving endpoints running on port 8000 (by default) to accept optimization input data and return optimized routing solutions.

Estimated Workshop Time: 45 minutes
