# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Learn how to build a fully automated machine learning pipeline by integrating Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services with Argo Workflows. This lab guides you through creating and deploying a scalable ML workflow for medical imaging, incorporating object storage for data management, OCI Functions and Events for triggering workflows, and Terraform for infrastructure deployment.

Estimated Workshop Time: 4 hours

### **Objectives**

Objective of this workshop is to set-up a ML pipeline using OCI Functions, OKE and Argo Workflow:

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Configure & set-up the pipeline
* Train and validate a model on medical images

### **Prerequisites**

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud account
* Administrator privileges or access rights to the OCI tenancy
* Ability to create resources with Public IP addresses (Load Balancer, Instances, OKE API Endpoint)
* Ability to create Dynamic Groups
